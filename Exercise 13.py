# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate
# and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can
# use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in
# the sequence to generate.(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of
# numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous
# two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
